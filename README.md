# Main Editor

The goal of this editor is to have a simple, distraction-free writing experience.

## Where we're at now

You can edit the text, and it will count the words!
Supports different kinds of formatting (h1, h2, )
BUT: no pictures


It saves your work to IndexedDB, so it's not lost when you close the browser.
You can see your previous docs!


## Todos

Give each doc a unique ID!! so that it doesn't save another copy when you save it again.

I'd like a document structure -- so every doc can have something like

@globalspace/mwufi/intro


## Out there....

Every page is a database of stuff! So, I can have a page called Books and it'll just have an attached DB. isnt that cool?

You can create a DB just via one line...

and you can use this page as an API too.

eoverse.org/@globalspace/books
