# Main Editor

The goal of this editor is to have a simple, distraction-free writing experience.

## Where we're at now

You can edit the text, and it will count the words!
Supports different kinds of formatting (h1, h2, )
BUT: no pictures


It saves your work to IndexedDB, so it's not lost when you close the browser.
